	+Tech Description:
		XSTR("The recent apparition of this missile in the Shivan arsenal has GTVA specialist worried about its potential, and what it implies regarding Shivan subspace and weapon technology. The theory of such a weapon has been layed by various Alliance weapon and subspace specialists over the past year, although no official document regarding this experimental doctrine has been released yet, and most research projects, such as the 'C' variant of the TAG missile, are still in draft status. The Shivans, however, have started using these weapons shortly before the Sathanas' destruction, taking GTVA capital ships and fighter pilots by surprise.

The tactical premise of this missile is similar to the Alliance's TAG missile, although the technology is far more complex and hold more potential. Like the initial ideas for the hypothetical TAG-C missile, this Shivan weapon acts as a subspace beacon once it hits it intended target, transmitting the tagged ship's exact coordinates to a remote weapon platform, which then fire a salvo of heavy anti-capital ship missiles through subspace.
The most common variant of Shivan subspace TAG missile calls in salvoes of 3 Subspace Missiles", -1)

	+Tech Description:
		XSTR("The recently-appeared Shivan Subspace Missile seems to be an offshoot of the Shivan 'Megabomb'. A slightly larger warhead, the Shivan SSM is equipped with a lightweight, possibly one-shot, subspace drive, a much stronger engine with an extended fuel cell, at the cost of a slightly inferior payload when compared to the Megabomb. On the field, these weapons pose a much greater threat to allied warships than flights of Shivan bombers equipped with a more traditional ordnance, as it often takes gunners and escort pilots by surprise, and reach their target within a few seconds of their arrival.

			The Subspace Missiles are fired from some variants of the Demon-class destroyer. Engaging these vessels is a high priority, as it limits the Shivan's ability to launch SSM strikes on vulnerable allied warships.",-1)

		It is unclear who fires the additional bombs, as no Shivan bomber or warship as been seen firing out-bound Mordiggian bombs to this day. Some have theorized that the warheads could be fired from inside a large Shivan capital ship, most likely a Juggernaut since these bombs started being deployed after the arrival of the Sathanas fleet in Capella. Others suggest that a new type of specialized capital ship may be firing them, staying hidden far away from the battlefields and having evaded contact with allied ships in the confusion reigning in the Capella system.",-1)
